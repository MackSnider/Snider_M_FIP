# Final Integrated Project - Brand Mashup 2021 Mackenzie Snider

This project was made over the course of term 2 at Fanshawe College for the Interactive Media Design Program. I also learned some key concepts in my first term.

## Motivation

Over the course of the term, I found was to motivate myself to get this project finished. It was a lot of fun so I did not mind dedicating time towards this project. 

## Usage

This project was made around a fake beer company that I had to make. When I am in the working world, I will be able to use tgis project as a template. I know my father would like me to make him a website so I could use the things I have learned while making this project to help me design and publish his.

## inspiration

While designing this project, I got inpiration from the companies Bandaid and Amstel Beer. These were the 2 companies that I was required to mash together. I also got inspiration from many other beer companies. This helped me fully understand how I should design not only my branding, but also the website.

## Credit

The credit goes all to me, Mackenzie Snider. I did not choose to have a partner for this project. I thought that I would be more than capable to do this entire project by myself.
